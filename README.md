# Human_Activity_RecognitionModel
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) model classifies physical activities like walking, running, or sitting using sensor data from wearables (accelerometers/gyroscopes). Built with ML/DL models, this project includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation pipelines. Ideal for fitness tracking and smart health applications.
